	"content": "Multi-layer Security Approaches for Amazon VPC Purpose In this Workshop, practical guidance for securing Amazon VPC will be covered. It is aimed at cloud architects, system administrators, network administrators, and security administrators who are responsible for designing, developing, and running services in AWS.\nTherefore, you must know the basics such as subnets, security groups, VPC flow logs. The focus will be on the range of services and additional features that AWS provides to allow you to operate VPC securely. Here, AWS Network Firewall, VPC Network Access Analyzer, Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall, AWS Systems Manager, Traffic Mirroring, AWS WAF, Gateway Load Balancer, etc., will be covered. IPv6 will also be used in some labs - but don\u0026rsquo;t worry, the Workshop is ready to help!\nAll examples given will follow best practices for securing, designing, and managing Amazon VPC. Ultimately, you should have an understanding of how and why each of these can be used, and the knowledge needed to apply what you have learned to your own environment.\nContent Workshop Overview Preparation Steps Track: DNS Security Track: Network Analysis Track: AWS Network Firewall (IPv6) Track: Third-Party Firewall using Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) Track: Web Application Firewall Cleanup "

	"content": "Architecture Diagram An overview of the initial architecture is shown below: The workshop focuses on \u0026ldquo;LabVpc\u0026rdquo;, simulating infrastructure with two Availability Zones (AZ) and deploying four network layers: Public Subnets (PubSubnets): These have a default route to the Internet Gateway and contain a NAT Gateway, an Application Load Balancer (webAlb), and EC2 instances. Private Subnets (PriSubnets): These have a default route to the NAT gateways in the Public Subnets and contain an Auto Scaling Group for EC2 web servers and an EC2 instance to handle mirrored traffic (mirrorInstance). Isolated Subnets (EndSubnets): These have no default routes and contain PrivateLink endpoints for AWS services such as CloudFormation, CloudWatch, and Systems Manager. Firewall Subnets (FwSubnets): These do not have a default route yet but will use AWS Network Firewall later in the workshop. Some additional components have been pre-deployed, such as AWS Network Firewall, Amazon CloudFront (using webAlb as the origin), and CloudWatch Log Groups. Links to these resources can be found on the CloudWatch Dashboard after logging into the AWS workshop account or deploying the CloudFormation stack into a personal account.\nAdditional Infrastructure The workshop uses an additional VPC (ExtVpc) to simulate Internet-facing targets, containing public subnets and an Internet-facing ALB. This ALB provides a simple Lambda response for information retrieval.\nAdditionally, Lambda functions run every minute, triggered by an Amazon EventBridge rule, to monitor the workshop infrastructure status and check task completion.\nNo changes are required for any of these additional infrastructure components throughout the workshop.\n"

NFW routing for IPv6 Objective: Ensure that all ingress and egress traffic is inspected by AWS Network Firewall before reaching public and private subnets. Work done: Configured a firewall subnet with AWS Network Firewall deployed. Next steps: Modify the IPv6 route tables to ensure all ingress and egress traffic passes through the Network Firewall. This is how the route tables will handle the configuration afterwards Note: When you add Network Firewall endpoints to a VPC, they appear as Gateway Load Balancer endpoints (technically, AWS Network Firewall uses Gateway Load Balancer). The CloudWatch dashboard will help you identify the correct endpoint IDs.\nAdd default route via IGW to the FW route tables In the AWS Management Console, start typing VPC into the quick search box and press Enter: Go to VPC → Route Tables and filter by LabVpc in the left box.

Go to the Lab E CloudWatch Dashboard to check the correct GWLB endpoint for each subnet.\nYou will see two new routes with the VPC Network Firewall GWLB endpoint as the target. On the Edge associations tab, click on Edit edge association Then select Internet Gateway and Save Changes\nModify Public subnets route tables Go to VPC → Route Tables and filter by LabVpc. Select LabVpc/PubSubnet1RouteTable and click on the Routes tab. Click on Edit Routes. We need to modify the ::/0 rule. Remove the IGW as the target and click on Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint. As a best practice, the selected endpoint needs to be in the same AZ as the subnet the route table is associated with. Go to the Lab E CloudWatch Dashboard to check the correct GWLB endpoint for each subnet. Add a route and now configure it so that all traffic must go to the Network Firewall before leaving the VPC Destination: ::/0 Target: vpce-xxxx This is how your route table will look. Please note that we are only configuring routes for IPv6, so IPv4 still points to the IGW, while IPv6 points to the NFW endpoint.\nNow, repeat steps 1-4 for LabVpc/PubSubnet2RouteTable.

Tips Working with IPv6\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t worked with IPv6 before, here are a few things to remember:\nThe default route for IPv6 is ::/0 (equivalent to 0.0.0.0/0 for IPv4). When allocating an IPv6 CIDR block to a VPC, the VPC receives a /56 public IPv6 address block; each subnet receives a /64 allocation from this block. Working with VPC routing\nTo configure routing in the VPC, think about each hop of the packet from source to destination.

Limit traffic from specific CloudFront: Only allow traffic from a specific CloudFront distribution to access WebAlb, rather than any CloudFront distribution that might know about WebAlb. Starting Point Ensure Traffic to WebAlb Only from CloudFront: Consider methods to ensure that all traffic to WebAlb only comes from CloudFront infrastructure. Use AWS WAF to Inspect L7 Traffic: After ensuring traffic only comes from CloudFront, consider using AWS WAF to inspect Layer 7 (L7) traffic and verify that requests come from the CloudFront distribution you control.

	"content": "Objective: Before starting the labs, you need to configure security controls for your VPC so that the WebAlb load balancer can receive HTTP/HTTPS requests from your laptop\u0026rsquo;s internet connection. This workshop uses managed prefix lists in VPC to help you achieve this. IPv6 has been enabled on some deployed resources, and although your computer may not be configured to connect via IPv6, we have included an option to allow IPv6 connections if available.\nNote that in many cases, traffic may not come from your computer\u0026rsquo;s actual IP address but from an HTTP or NAT gateway of the connecting network. We call this the \u0026ldquo;Gateway IP Address,\u0026rdquo; and this address will differ for IPv4 and IPv6.\nStarting Point: Your goal in this lab is to update your VPC security controls so that the WebAlb load balancer can receive HTTP traffic (TCP port 80) from the Gateway IP address. We have added rules to some of WebAlb\u0026rsquo;s security groups referencing VPC prefix lists to address this. After adding your Gateway IP address to the correct managed prefix list, you will be able to browse from your computer to the WebAlb load balancer. Pre-deployed Infrastructure The following resources have been pre-deployed to assist you:\nWebAlb Load Balancer (\u0026ldquo;webAlb\u0026rdquo;): Includes a few EC2 instances behind it, providing some useful information. Security Group for WebAlb (\u0026ldquo;LabVpc/webAlbSG\u0026rdquo;): Contains inbound rules for \u0026ldquo;workshopPrefixListIPv4\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;workshopPrefixListIPv6\u0026rdquo;. Managed Prefix List for VPC (IPv4) (\u0026ldquo;workshopPrefixListIPv4\u0026rdquo;): This list is currently empty. For IPv4, use CIDR format like x.x.x.x/32. Managed Prefix List for VPC (IPv6) (\u0026ldquo;workshopPrefixListIPv6\u0026rdquo;): This list is also currently empty. For IPv6, use the format xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::/128. You can find links to WebAlb and CloudFront endpoints on the introductory CloudWatch dashboard.\nServices Used: Amazon VPC Managed Prefix Lists: Description: Managed prefix lists in Amazon VPC allow you to create and manage lists of CIDR blocks that you can reference in security group rules and route tables. Documentation: Amazon VPC Managed Prefix Lists Documentation Amazon VPC Security Groups: Description: Security groups in Amazon VPC act as virtual firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic to Amazon EC2 resources in the VPC. Documentation: Amazon VPC Security Groups Documentation AWS CheckIp: Description: A simple AWS service that allows you to check your public IP address, helping to identify the Gateway IP address you need to add to the prefix list. Website: AWS CheckIp Tips: What are Prefix lists?\nPrefix lists are collections of CIDR blocks that simplify the configuration and management of security groups and route tables. Instead of referencing individual IP addresses, you can use prefix lists to group commonly used IP addresses into a set and apply them in security or routing rules. This helps consolidate rules with the same port and protocol but different CIDRs into a single rule. Reference Documentation Finding your Gateway IP address\nTo restrict access to your laptop, you need to find the \u0026ldquo;gateway\u0026rdquo; IP address that your network uses to connect to the internet, which can be done via the AWS CheckIp website. This address is a single IP, and to turn it into a valid CIDR range, you need to add /32 at the end. If you cannot find it, you can use 0.0.0.0/0 (IPv4) or ::/0 (IPv6) to allow access from anywhere, but this is a last resort. Managing your own prefix lists\nAmazon VPC allows you to create and manage your own prefix lists, which can be referenced in other VPC constructs like security groups and route tables. You can use the existing prefix lists \u0026ldquo;workshopPrefixListIPv4\u0026rdquo;, add your gateway IP address to it, and use it to control access through the WebAlb security group (\u0026ldquo;LabVpc/webAlbSG\u0026rdquo;).

Next task: Block this website to prevent access while continuing the investigation. Solution: Deploy and configure mechanisms to prevent instances in the VPC from resolving that domain name. The goal is to temporarily block access to the suspicious domain from the VPC to ensure safety during the investigation.\nStarting Point: There are several approaches to deny access to the suspicious domain, such as VPC security groups or network ACLs, but they only block traffic to specific IP addresses. If the malicious website switches to another IP address, these blocks will become ineffective. Instead, in this lab, we will use a DNS firewall to prevent resources in the VPC from resolving the IP address of the suspicious domain. The goal is to use the DNS firewall to effectively block the domain name, regardless of IP changes.\nServices Used Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall - Documentation Amazon CloudWatch Log Insights - Documentation Success Criteria Instances in LabVpc can no longer successfully resolve the IP address of the suspicious domain you identified in Lab A (bad.sa-demos.net). The Lab B CloudWatch Dashboard will show your progress. Note that attempts to query the suspicious domain will return an NXDOMAIN response. Tips To enable and configure the DNS firewall The DNS firewall can be found in the Amazon Route 53 Resolver section of the AWS console. The process is:\nCreate a domain list containing the suspicious domain bad.sa-demos.net. Create a rule group to BLOCK (using NXDOMAIN response) requests to the domain list you created above.

	"description": "",
	"content": "Objective Further investigate the publicInstance exposed to the Internet. Inspect HTTP requests on TCP port 443 to detect suspicious activity. Consider both IPv6 and IPv4 traffic. Starting Point VPC traffic logs only provide information about traffic at the flow level. AWS provides tools to capture and analyze packets from Elastic Network Interfaces. Pre-deployed Infrastructure The EC2 instance mirrorInstance has been configured to receive packets for analysis. Use network ID 308308 for VXLAN encapsulation. A mirror filter has been pre-created to exclude internal VPC traffic. Additional rules need to be added to the filter to mirror HTTPS (TCP:443) traffic and its responses from the internet. Services Used Amazon VPC Traffic Mirroring - Documentation Success Criteria: Configure mirrorInstance as a mirror target for VPC traffic mirroring.\nAdd additional rules to the pre-created mirror filter to include:\nTraffic sent to the Internet (Destination TCP port 443) from publicInstance (including both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic). Traffic returned from the Internet (Source TCP port 443) to publicInstance (including both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic). Note: IPv4 and IPv6 require separate rules in the mirror filter. Create a mirror session to start capturing packets and sending them to mirrorInstance.\nInstructions for connecting and using tshark:\nConnect to mirrorInstance: Use Session Manager to connect to mirrorInstance. Run the tshark command: Open a terminal and run the following command to view the mirrored traffic: sudo tshark -i vxlan0 -Y http -T fields -e ipv6.src -e ipv6.dst -e http.request.method -e http.request.uri -e http.file_data Tips Configuring a Mirror Target\nA mirror target can be EC2 instances, Network Load Balancers, or Gateway Load Balancers. In this workshop, we will use an EC2 instance as the target. The Traffic Mirroring interface requires you to specify an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) rather than directly specifying the EC2 instance. You can find the ENI ID of mirrorInstance in the Lab D CloudWatch Dashboard. Configuring a Mirror Filter\nA mirror filter helps determine what type of traffic will be mirrored to the target. You can include and/or exclude specific types of traffic (based on source/destination port, source/destination IP, protocol) through rules. The filter will process rules in the specified order, stopping when a match is found. In this lab, we want to mirror traffic leaving LabVpc to port 443 on the internet. Two rules are needed: One rule for outbound requests to port 443. One rule for responses from port 443 back to the original source port. Each rule must be specific to either IPv4 or IPv6, so a total of 4 rules are needed. Starting a Mirror Session\nEach mirror session represents a single mirror source, sending traffic matching a mirror filter to a single mirror target. Mirror filters can be reused in multiple sessions, and a mirror target can be used by multiple mirror sessions. However, a source can only be associated with a single mirror session. The mirror source is identified by the Elastic Network Interface (ENI), rather than the instance ID. You can find the ENI ID of publicInstance in the Lab D CloudWatch Dashboard.

This will allow Suricata to inspect all IPv4 traffic entering and leaving through the IGW. The firewall has been pre-configured to block all traffic to https://www.facebook.com over IPv4.\nStarting Point In the previous lab, you created a GWLB (Gateway Load Balancer) Endpoint service in the GWLB VPC. Now, you need to create an endpoint in the FW Subnet of the Lab VPC. To inspect all ingress and egress traffic, you need to configure the route tables to ensure traffic passes through the AWS Gateway Load Balancer endpoints in the FwSubnets before leaving and entering the VPC. Pre-deployed Infrastructure AWS GWLB service endpoint (from the previous lab). LabVpc/FwSubnet1 and LabVpc/FwSubnet2 (one in each AZ). Note: If you have completed Lab E (NFW firewall routing configuration), one of the tasks below (associating the edge route table with the LabVpc IGW) may have already been done. You still need to add routes to this route table.\nServices Used Amazon VPC- Route Tables Documentation AWS Gateway Load Balancer - Documentation Success Criteria You have created/reused the edge route table and associated it with the LabVpc IGW. You have added a route for each IPv4 PubSubnet CIDR block to the edge route table via the GWLB endpoints. You have added a default route from each FWSubnet to the IGW.
