	"content": "What is VPC Network Access Analyzer? Network Access Analyzer is a feature that helps identify unintended network access to your resources on AWS: Understand, verify, and improve your network security posture: Network Access Analyzer helps you identify unintended network access against your security and compliance requirements, allowing you to take steps to improve network security. Demonstrate compliance: You can use Network Access Analyzer to demonstrate that your network on AWS meets certain compliance requirements. Verify your network security posture: Network Access Analyzer allows you to specify network security requirements and identify potential network paths that do not meet those requirements. Why do you need Network Access Analyzer? Problem: As organizations expand their cloud environments and distributed application teams begin to operate network infrastructure, it becomes difficult to determine whether there are adequate network controls in place to achieve the organization\u0026rsquo;s security and compliance goals. Validate network controls: Customers struggle to validate network controls because they have to manually test and audit network designs and configurations, which is not scalable and time-consuming. Operations and network teams need to demonstrate the presence of network controls for security requirements, especially during external audits, making the process tedious and inefficient. Network controls quickly become outdated: Due to the ever-changing customer environment with evolving security requirements, changes in network design, and the continuous launch of new AWS network services. Operations teams try to ensure a compliant environment by restricting developers from using certain AWS services or applying manual approval processes for configuration changes. Both methods put pressure on the operations team and make development teams feel they cannot move as quickly as desired. What is VPC Reachability Analyzer? Reachability Analyzer is a configuration analysis tool that allows you to perform connectivity tests between a source resource and a destination resource within your virtual private clouds (VPCs). Key functions: Connectivity testing: When the destination resource is reachable, Reachability Analyzer provides step-by-step details of the virtual network path between the source and destination. Identify issues: If the destination resource is not reachable, Reachability Analyzer identifies the component blocking it. These issues can be due to misconfigurations in security groups, network ACLs, route tables, or load balancers. Architecture Diagram This architecture is provided through pre-configured AWS CloudFormation and will be used in the lab. "

Click Analyze. Scroll down to explore the findings after the analysis is complete. Each finding displays the network path from the Internet through the internet gateway to resources in AWS (e.g., EC2 instances). This is where you will review each finding and flag/take action on those findings/paths that are not intended for internet access. Select the first finding by clicking the radio button, and in the right pane, you can click on the resource to view additional information about the specific resource. Summary: Lab 1 completed.\nIn this lab, we performed the following steps: Enabled Amazon VPC Network Access Analyzer: Activated this feature to analyze network traffic paths. Analyzed ingress traffic: Checked paths from the internet gateway using the default Amazon network access scope. This process helps us identify network configurations that could lead to unintended access to resources in the individual\u0026rsquo;s VPC.\n"

In the \u0026ldquo;Explanations\u0026rdquo; section, select the arrow next to \u0026ldquo;Details\u0026rdquo; to check detailed information about the component or combination of components blocking the path. (For example: in the following explanation, because the security group does not have the appropriate inbound rule, traffic from external sources cannot reach the destination resource, resulting in a blocked network connection.) Scroll down and check the Path details section to see a representation of the shortest path between the Source and Destination. Troubleshooting Click on the address provided under Explanations. After selecting the address, it will navigate to the Security Group page of EC2. Select Outbound Rules and choose Edit Outbound rules. Click \u0026ldquo;Add rule\u0026rdquo; and select Type as Custom TCP, Port range as 5432, Destination IP address range as 10.1.0.0/16 and click Save rules. After saving, go back to the Reachability Analyzer page and select Analyze path, then select Confirm. We see that the Reachability status is Reachable. Summary: Lab 5 completed.\nIn this lab, we learned how to create an analysis in the VPC Reachability Analyzer and how this tool helps in identifying connectivity issues between two AWS resources. Key points: Create analysis: Use VPC Reachability Analyzer to check connectivity between two resources, such as EC2 instances or VPCs. Identify connectivity issues: The tool helps detect issues such as: Security group rules blocking traffic. Incorrect route table configurations. Other network components that may impede connectivity. Provide detailed information: VPC Reachability Analyzer provides clear information about traffic paths and related components, making it easier to diagnose and troubleshoot issues. This tool is very useful in maintaining the availability and performance of AWS services.\n"
