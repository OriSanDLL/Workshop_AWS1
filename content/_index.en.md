# Observing and Diagnosing Your Network on AWS

### Overview
- Network Access Analyzer is a feature that helps identify unintended network access to your resources on AWS. You can use Network Access Analyzer to specify your network access requirements and identify potential network paths that do not meet the specified requirements.
- Reachability Analyzer is a configuration analysis tool that allows you to perform connectivity tests between a source resource and a destination resource within your virtual private clouds (VPCs). When the destination resource is reachable, Reachability Analyzer provides step-by-step details of the virtual network path between the source and destination. When the destination resource is not reachable, Reachability Analyzer identifies the component blocking it.
- AWS Network Manager allows you to centrally manage your AWS Cloud WAN core network and AWS Transit Gateway network across AWS accounts, Regions, and on-premises locations.
