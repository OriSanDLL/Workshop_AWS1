### Preparation
- Deploy the resources by creating a CloudFormation stack from the linked file [**here**](https://static.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/public/a0087a8b-4167-471e-bba8-3828b833ae22/static/netwks.yaml) in your personal AWS account (estimated cost $1.50-$2.00 per hour).
- Ensure to clean up after completing the workshop to avoid incurring additional costs.
- Use a separate AWS account dedicated to learning and experimentation, not one containing production resources.
- The necessary IAM permissions for deployment and cleanup are listed [**here**](https://static.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/public/a0087a8b-4167-471e-bba8-3828b833ae22/static/netwks-iam-policy.json).
- When deploying the CloudFormation template, accept all default settings.
- The deployment process takes 15-20 minutes. Once the stacks show the status Create_Complete, proceed to the Workshop Overview.

### Note on resource costs:

If using your personal AWS account, make sure to follow the cleanup steps at the end of the workshop to stop ongoing charges for services used during the workshop.

### Equipment:

To complete this workshop, you will need your own laptop. It should have internet access to connect via HTTPS and HTTP.
