### Approach
- The workshop revolves around Amazon VPC architecture with challenges based on real-world scenarios.
- Each challenge (Lab) provides objectives, starting points, and suggested services. There are hints and detailed instructions if needed.
- Each Lab has its own CloudWatch dashboard, containing additional instructions and links to deployed resources.
- The top right corner of the dashboard shows the number of tasks completed.
- You must complete all tasks of the first Lab before moving on to the next Lab.
- **Note:** If there are warnings about custom widgets when loading the dashboard, click **"Execute them all"** to track progress.
