### Configuring
1. Create GWLB Endpoint:
   - Create a GWLB endpoint in each Firewall (FW) subnet in LabVpc to redirect traffic.
2. Update route tables:
   - Modify the route tables to ensure all traffic to or from the IGW is inspected by the Suricata firewall.

The Suricata firewall has been pre-configured with two rules: The first rule blocks traffic to https://www.facebook.com. The second rule blocks ICMP ping to 9.9.9.9.

### Create Endpoint in LabVpc
1. Go to VPC -> Endpoints and click create Endpoint
- **Name**: GWLB-endpoint-1
- **Service Category**: Other Endpoint services
- **Service Settings**: paste the GWLB's service name created in the previous lab.

If you did not note down your endpoint name, click the link [here](https://ap-southeast-2.signin.aws.amazon.com/oauth?client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Asignin%3A%3A%3Aconsole%2Fvpcconsole&code_challenge=qOqEpqCBj9MZuHfJD2RtruSSCuvThI37dR3pdmDDfIk&code_challenge_method=SHA-256&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fvpcconsole%2Fhome%3FhashArgs%3D%2523EndpointServices%26isauthcode%3Dtrue%26oauthStart%3D1726717506767%26state%3DhashArgsFromTB_ap-southeast-2_fc379777bbcacefc) and check the service name in the Details tab.

- Click "Verify Service". It will display a confirmation message for the service name.
- Check Subnet

- After confirmation, you will have the option to select the VPC.
- VPC: Select LabVpc.
- Subnets: Select LabVpc/FWSubnet1.
- Click *Create*

Although you can select multiple subnets at this step, each GWLB endpoint can only be associated with a single subnet. Therefore, you need to create two GWLB endpoints, one for each AZ.

**Repeat the above steps for the LabVpc/FWSubnet2 subnet**

2. Go to VPC -> Endpoint Services.
3. Click on GWLB-Endpoint.
4. Select the "Endpoint connections" tab.
5. Select the endpoint you want to accept the connection request for.
6. Click "Actions" and select "Accept endpoint connection request".

### Add default route via IGW to the FW route tables
This is how the route tables will handle the configuration afterward:
![H9](/images/structure/H9.png)
1. In the AWS Management Console, start typing "VPC" into the quick search box at the top and press Enter.
2. Go to VPC â†’ Route Tables and filter by LabVpc.
3. Select LabVpc/FwSubnet1RouteTable and click on the Routes tab. Click Edit Routes.

4. Add a route and configure it so that all traffic should go to the internet gateway.
- **Destination**: 0.0.0.0/0
- **Target**: igw-xxxx..

5. Repeat the above steps for **LabVpc/FwSubnet2RouteTable**
